# Flexy

Flexy is a mobile application designed to assist people suffering from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The project was created using Figma, which is a user interface design tool, and aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for users to access medical resources and track their progress.

## Features

The Flexy app has five main navigation tabs:

- Dashboard: Displays a graph that shows the user's performance in terms of the time spent on performing exercises. The user can also see how well they performed compared to the previous weeks, and the average time spent on exercises that week.
- Medicine: Shows recommended medicines that a user can take to improve their condition. By clicking on a medicine, a user will be taken to the next screen where the medicine is briefly explained. The details screen also has links to Amazon through which a user can order the medicines online and get them delivered to their house.
- Exercise: Displays recommended exercises that a user can perform. When clicked, the user is taken to the details screen where they can see written instructions on how to perform the exercise.
- Tests: Displays tests that can be performed by the user. When a user clicks "yes" to the symptoms, a dialog appears that asks the level of pain they are experiencing. When clicked on "submit" after selecting the pain level, the results are stored into the test history.
- Profile: Displays the user's data and allows the user to modify any of the data. The user can also access test results and see the tests that were taken and the summary of the tests.
